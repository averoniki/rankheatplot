  <p class="q">Q: What is rank-heat plot?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: The rank-heat plot summarizes results from a network meta-analysis on all
    interventions and all outcomes, providing information regarding the ranking
    of interventions per outcome. It is a visualization technique that combines
    the features of a heatmap and a ranked bar chart across multiple outcomes.
    It allows for the simultaneous comparison of multiple interventions across
    different outcomes.
  </p>
  <p class="q">Q: How does rank-heat plot work?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: The rank-heat plot displays the hierarchy for the total number of
    treatments (presented in different radii) across all outcomes (presented in
    different concentric circles) with respect to their effectiveness and
    safety. The intervention rankings are colour-coded using a gradient color
    scheme (red, yellow, and green), indicating their magnitude. The
    colour-coded ranking scale ranges from the red to green, representing the
    lowest (red) to the highest (green) value of the ranking statistic. Only the
    colour of each sector is interpretable. The area of each sector does not
    convey any information. Uncoloured sectors suggest that data on that outcome
    were not reported for the particular treatment in the trials included in the
    network meta-analysis. The ranking statistic values are also displayed on
    the plot.

  <p class="q">Q: What are the advantages of using a rank-heat plot?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: The rank-heat plot provides a comprehensive and intuitive visual overview
    of intervention rankings across outcomes. It allows for easy identification
    of high-ranking or low-ranking interventions within each outcome, with
    respect to their effectiveness and/or safety. It also facilitates pattern
    recognition and comparisons between interventions. It can also identify
    interventions that have not been studied for an included outcome. The tool
    can be used to facilitate interpretation and decision-making based on NMA
    synthesis.
  </p>
  <p class="q">Q: What type of data is suitable for rank-heat plot?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: The rank-heat plot is suitable for any type of outcome data that involve
    multiple (i.e., >2) interventions and outcomes, from any type of discipline
    and disease and any type of review (i.e., systematic review, rapid review,
    overview of reviews). It can produce the rank-heat plot when the study-level
    data for each outcome are available, and without performing the NMA analysis
    outside the tool.
  </p>
  <p class="q">Q: Can rank-heat plot handle large datasets?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: Yes, the rank-heat plot can handle large datasets with a large number of
    interventions and outcomes. However, it is important to ensure that the plot
    remains readable and interpretable by adjusting the plot size and presented
    text (e.g., outcome and treatment names and numerical ranking values)
    appropriately.
  </p>
  <p class="q">
    Q: Are there any software packages or libraries used to create a rank-heat
    plot?
  </p>
  <p class="a">
    A: Yes, currently the rank-heat plot performs analyses in a frequentist
    framework importing intervention outcome results from the netmeta R package,
    where the network meta-analysis is performed for each outcome separately. In
    the next version of the tool, we plan to incorporate the option of
    conducting the analysis in a Bayesian framework, as well as outputs based on
    clinically important effects (e.g., minimal clinically important
    difference).
  </p>
  <p class="q">Q: How can I interpret a rank-heat plot?</p>
  <p class="a">
    A: In a rank-heat plot, high-ranking interventions are represented by darker
    green colours, while low-ranking interventions are represented by darker red
    colours. By comparing the colours within each category and examining the
    rank values, you can identify the interventions that perform relatively
    better or worse across the outcomes with respect to their effectiveness
    and/or safety.
