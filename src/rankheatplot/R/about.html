<p>
  The rank-heat plot summarizes results on all interventions and all outcomes,
  providing information regarding the ranking of interventions per outcome. We
  developed the rankheatplot R Shiny app to produce the rank-heat plot when the
  study-level data for each outcome are available, and by performing the network
  meta-analysis within the tool. The tool can be used for any type of data, and
  in any type of discipline and disease using a network meta-analysis of
  multiple interventions compared in studies obtained from any type of review
  (i.e., systematic review, rapid review, overview of reviews). The tool allows
  the fast identification of the most likely best and worst interventions, with
  respect to their effectiveness and/or safety, in a given outcome. It can also
  identify interventions that have not been studied for an included outcome. The
  tool can be used to facilitate interpretation and decision-making based on
  results from a network meta-analysis. The rankheatplot app currently performs
  analyses in a frequentist framework importing intervention outcome results
  from the netmeta R package (Gerta Rücker, Guido Schwarzer, Ulrike Krahn and
  Jochem König 2017,

<p>
  Navigate to the &quot;Upload data&quot; tab above to submit your .xlsx file
  for processing. Before you start, please make sure that your data meet the
  <strong>formatting guidelines</strong> listed below.
</p>
<h2 id="formatting-guidelines">Formatting Guidelines</h2>
<p>
  The rank heat plot expects the uploaded data to be a spreadsheet in the .xlsx
  format. The data for each treatment outcome should be included in its own
  sheet, and the name of each sheet will be used to label that outcome in the
  plot. The required format of each sheet, including required column names and
  data types, will vary according to the type of data being uploaded and the
  type of analysis being requested. Below is a list of required columns and
  their corresponding data types.
